# foundry_sdk.v1.ontologies.models.SearchOrdering


SearchOrdering

## Exact SDK definition

Python names are SDK attributes; `alias` values are wire names. `Optional` permits null; a default controls omission. A nullable field without a default remains required. `Literal` lists values; `Annotated` retains constraints and discriminators. Request TypedDicts and response Pydantic models are distinct shapes.

## Fields and wire names

Model fields use their declared defaults and aliases. Nullable and omittable are separate; SDK model serialization uses aliases and excludes None values.

| SDK field | Wire name | Type | Omission/default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| field | field | FieldNameV1 | required; no default | No additional field description in SDK source. |
| direction | direction | typing.Optional[str] | None | Specifies the ordering direction (can be either `asc` or `desc`) |

```python
class SearchOrdering(core.ModelBase):
    """SearchOrdering"""

    field: FieldNameV1
    direction: typing.Optional[str] = None
    """Specifies the ordering direction (can be either `asc` or `desc`)"""
```
