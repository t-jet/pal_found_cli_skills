# foundry_sdk.v2.media_sets.models.LogicalTimestamp



A number representing a logical ordering to be used for transactions, etc.
This can be interpreted as a timestamp in microseconds, but may differ slightly from system clock time due 
to clock drift and slight adjustments for the sake of ordering.

Only positive timestamps (representing times after epoch) are supported.


## Exact SDK definition

Python names are SDK attributes; `alias` values are wire names. `Optional` permits null; a default controls omission. A nullable field without a default remains required. `Literal` lists values; `Annotated` retains constraints and discriminators. Request TypedDicts and response Pydantic models are distinct shapes.

```python
LogicalTimestamp: typing_extensions.TypeAlias = core.Long
```
