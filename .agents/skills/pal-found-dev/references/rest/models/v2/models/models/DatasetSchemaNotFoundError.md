# foundry_sdk.v2.models.models.DatasetSchemaNotFoundError


A schema could not be found for the specified dataset.

## Exact SDK definition

Python names are SDK attributes; `alias` values are wire names. `Optional` permits null; a default controls omission. A nullable field without a default remains required. `Literal` lists values; `Annotated` retains constraints and discriminators. Request TypedDicts and response Pydantic models are distinct shapes.

## Fields and wire names

Model fields use their declared defaults and aliases. Nullable and omittable are separate; SDK model serialization uses aliases and excludes None values.

| SDK field | Wire name | Type | Omission/default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dataset_rid | datasetRid | core_models.DatasetRid | required; no default | The RID of the dataset whose schema was not found. |
| type | type | typing.Literal['datasetSchemaNotFound'] | 'datasetSchemaNotFound' | No additional field description in SDK source. |

```python
class DatasetSchemaNotFoundError(core.ModelBase):
    """A schema could not be found for the specified dataset."""

    dataset_rid: core_models.DatasetRid = pydantic.Field(alias=str("datasetRid"))  # type: ignore[literal-required]
    """The RID of the dataset whose schema was not found."""

    type: typing.Literal["datasetSchemaNotFound"] = "datasetSchemaNotFound"
```
