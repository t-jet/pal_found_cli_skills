# foundry_sdk.v2.admin.models.MarkingCategoryPermissionsIsPublic


If true, all users who are members of at least one of the Organizations from organizationRids can view the Markings in the category. If false, only users who are explicitly granted the VIEW role can view the Markings in the category.

## Exact SDK definition

Python names are SDK attributes; `alias` values are wire names. `Optional` permits null; a default controls omission. A nullable field without a default remains required. `Literal` lists values; `Annotated` retains constraints and discriminators. Request TypedDicts and response Pydantic models are distinct shapes.

```python
MarkingCategoryPermissionsIsPublic: typing_extensions.TypeAlias = bool
```
