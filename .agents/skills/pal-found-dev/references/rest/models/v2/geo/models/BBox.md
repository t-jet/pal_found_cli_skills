# foundry_sdk.v2.geo.models.BBox



A GeoJSON object MAY have a member named "bbox" to include
information on the coordinate range for its Geometries, Features, or
FeatureCollections. The value of the bbox member MUST be an array of
length 2*n where n is the number of dimensions represented in the
contained geometries, with all axes of the most southwesterly point
followed by all axes of the more northeasterly point. The axes order
of a bbox follows the axes order of geometries.


## Exact SDK definition

Python names are SDK attributes; `alias` values are wire names. `Optional` permits null; a default controls omission. A nullable field without a default remains required. `Literal` lists values; `Annotated` retains constraints and discriminators. Request TypedDicts and response Pydantic models are distinct shapes.

```python
BBox: typing_extensions.TypeAlias = typing.List["Coordinate"]
```
