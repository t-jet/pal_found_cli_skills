# foundry_sdk.v2.orchestration.models.RetryCount



The number of retry attempts for failed Jobs within the Build. A Job's failure is not considered final until
all retries have been attempted or an error occurs indicating that retries cannot be performed. Be aware,
not all types of failures can be retried.


## Exact SDK definition

Python names are SDK attributes; `alias` values are wire names. `Optional` permits null; a default controls omission. A nullable field without a default remains required. `Literal` lists values; `Annotated` retains constraints and discriminators. Request TypedDicts and response Pydantic models are distinct shapes.

```python
RetryCount: typing_extensions.TypeAlias = int
```
